PROJECT GOALS
-------------
Create a user interface that is clean and usable with any screen size.
Use new technologies like e.g. flexbox, @media, font-icons or less.
Cleanup css/html and unify as much as possible.

WARNING: In current state we're focusing on main layout and logic!

INSTALLATION:
-------------
1. Clone git-master roundcube/roundcubemail
2. Switch to branch dev-elastic
3. Goto /skins
4. git clone https://github.com/roundcube/elastic.git
5. Before use disable all plugins (we're not there yet)

IDEAS/TODOs:
------------
- Planned use of a css framework, e.g. semantic-ui, bootstrap (to be decided)
- build custom semantic-ui style/js, we don't really want 800kB (already minified) file
- use semantic-ui/loader when loading content to content-frames (on phones only)?
