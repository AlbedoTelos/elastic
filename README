PROJECT GOALS
-------------
Create a user interface that is clean and usable with any screen size.
Use new technologies like e.g. flexbox, @media, font-icons or less.
Cleanup css/html and unify as much as possible.

------------------------------------------------------------------
WARNING: In current state we're focusing on main layout and logic!

INSTALLATION:
-------------
1. Clone git-master roundcube/roundcubemail
2. Switch to branch dev-elastic
3. Goto /skins
4. git clone https://github.com/roundcube/elastic.git
5. Before use disable all plugins (we're not there yet)

IDEAS/TODOs:
------------
- Planned use of a css framework, e.g. semantic-ui, bootstrap (to be decided)
- Minimum supported screen width: 320px (or we should support 240px?)
- As we use flexbox, we develop on most recent Chrome/Firefox, we'll
  see later what we can do for older browser versions
- use Less
- build custom semantic-ui style/js, we don't really want 800kB (already minified) file
- use semantic-ui/loader when loading content to content-frames (on phones only)?
- make scrollbars pretty (impossible in Firefox?)
- check supported browser versions, looks like flexbox is not supported on Android <= 4,
  how old versions we should support?
- popups/modal dialogs
- consider using a dialog popup for Contacts import instead of a separate page. Actually consider
  this a UI rule: no full page for functionality that can be in a dialog.
  Note: This is for consistency reasons, mail import uses dialog, calendar events import too.
  Note: the same rule would apply to contacts advanced search.
